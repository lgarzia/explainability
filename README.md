# explainability

Interpret models using model-agnostic and deep learning methods

- Feature Importance and Impact
- Global Model-Agnostic Interpretation
- Local Model-Agnostic Interpretation Methods
- Anchor and Counterfactual Explanations
- Visualizing Convolutional Neural Networks
- Interpretation Methods for Multivariate Forecasting and Sensitivity Analysis

**What matters most to the model and how does it matter?**

_Permutation Feature Importance_ --> rank the features intuitively and dependably
_Partial Dependence Plots_ --> Convey marginal impact of a single feature on prediction
_Individul Conditional Expectation (ICE)_ plots to explain changes with a prediction when a feature changes
