So, this is a built for a webscraper that should (if I uploaded this right) will snag and download data from the Missouri Highway Patrol accident website.

You can find the origins here -----> https://www.mshp.dps.missouri.gov/HP68/SearchAction

So this is my first scraper. My significant other has a cyber security background so she knows a lot when it comes to coding and different languages in general. She recommened that I use Splinter for this task. I Only have it working in Chrome and FireFox at the moment.

I guess this is still a work in progress but I got to start somewhere
